# custom rules

- This project implements an MCP Serverâ€”a server that uses the standardized Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable LLMs to communicate seamlessly with external data sources and tools.

- Always check and remove unnecessary imports.

- The basic `README.md` and **code comments** should be written in English.

- When modifying the `README.md`, always create an identical Korean version (`README_KOR.md`) separately.

- Do not deploy until instructed to do so, and do not commit arbitrarily.
